# PyBer_Analysis

## Analysis Overview
This analyisis is to create a summary insight into ride-sharing data by city types for a ridr sharing company called PyBer. The analysis is done using Python programming language, Pandas, and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
The analysis is intended to show how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Analysis Result
Rural city types pull in the lowest total ride fares, as a result of its fewer number of drivers conducting the lowest total rides. Inspite of the lowest total fares, Rural city types has the highest average fare per ride and highest average fare per driver. This can be attributed to its low availability of drivers resulting in lower supply of rides which perhaps drive up the fare price.
  * Rural city types total drivers is 78, providing 128 total rides. 
  * Rural city types avg. fare per ride and per driver is $35 and $55 respectively, resulting into total fares of $4,328.

Suburban city types formed better than rural city types in all analysis result categories;
  * with 6 times more total drivers than rural city types (490 drivers).
  * 5 times total rides provided more than the rural city types  (625 total rides).
  * PPulling in 4 times more total fares than the rural city types ($19,356 total fares), with
  * Lower fares fare per ride and per driver than the rural city types ($25 and $17 respectively).

Urban city types perform even better than both rural and suburban city types;
  * with 31 and 5 times more total drivers than rural suburban city types respectively (2405 drivers).
  * 13 and 3 times more total rides provided than the rural and. suburban city types respectively (1625 total rides).
  * Pulling in 9 and 2 times more total fares than the rural and suburban city types respectively ($39,854 total fares), with
  * Even lower fares fare per ride and per driver than the rural city types ($31 and $40 respectively).
This might perhaps be due to the size of the market/population in urban city types or not, in any case a further analysis of the market size is required

## Analysis Summarry
There is clearly a correlation, as shown by the analysis result between number of drives, total rides provided, fare per ride and per driver and the total fare generated which clearly shows the disparities among all three city types.
The more the number of drivers, the more rides will be provided, increasing the supply of rides, whicch in turn drives down the fare per ride and per driver. When the fare per ride is low as well as the fare per driver, this pushes more people to use ride services and eat up any excess ride services created by availability of more drivers. 
To address these disparities, I recommend that;
  * at least as much drivers in urban city types are made available in both rural and suburban city types.
  * Provide more cars for these additional drivers to help increase the number of rides that can be provided at any particular time.
  * A further analysis needs to be done to fully understand the nature of ride sharing market in all 3 city types before suggested changes are embarked upon.
